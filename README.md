# ANDIRPG

Very basic RPG written when I have nothing better to do using only my Android
device for coding. The whole experience is funny!

## DEPENDENCIES

In order to compile you need to have the following libraries installed:
- `libcunit` for the **tests**
- `ncurses` for the UI
- `libinih` for the configuration
